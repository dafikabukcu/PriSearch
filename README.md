Welcome to PriSearch.


## What is PriSearch?

PriSearch is a completely private, ungoogled-chromium browser with my own extensions created to make it a proper,
fully-functional browser.

## Why?

Since the change of policies in Firefox, I've decided to have a more private browser, and here we are.

## 2. Set it Up

1. Clone the repo
2. Launch "launchPriSearch.bat"
3. Click on three dots (at the top right corner) -> Extensions -> Manage Extensions
4. Enable Developer Mode (at the top right corner)
5. Click on "Load unpacked"
6. Click on one of the extension folders and click on "Select Folder"
	- privacy-dashboard
	- privateAIExt
	- spotiext
	- whatsappext
	Do it for your preferred extensions.


## 3. Use it!

You can just execute it by using the "launchPriSearch.bat - Shortcut.Ink". You can move that shortcut to
any folder you want, be sure not to change the location of the original bat file (launchPrisearch.bat).
